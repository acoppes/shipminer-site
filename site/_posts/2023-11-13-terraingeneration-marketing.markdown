Playing with terrain generation from image files to create marketing gifs. This idea the ship enters from a location, gather some minerals and leave, the terrain is reset and the cycle is repeated from different locations. 

<div class="post-image">
<img src="/assets/shipminer-subscribe-01.gif" />
</div>

This was a previous idea, the ship enters from the left, mine minerals and leave to the right.

<div class="post-image">
<img src="/assets/shipminer-subscribe-03.gif" />
</div>

_(Note: there is a typo in that image xD)_
