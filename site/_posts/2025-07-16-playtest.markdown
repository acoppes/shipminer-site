Hi Everyone!

I am working towards having a public Steam Demo (and maybe itchio too) in the next couple of months. In order to achieve that, I need to polish and define more stuff, and I need help from players in doing that.

I started a Steam Playtest at [https://store.steampowered.com/app/3113690/Ship_Miner/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3113690/Ship_Miner/?utm_source=homepage&utm_campaign=playtest) If you want to be part of it you can join through the steam button that looks like this:

<div class="post-image">
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3113690/Ship_Miner/?utm_source=homepage&utm_campaign=playtest">
<img src="/assets/steam_playtest_button.png" />
</a>
</div>

I will add more and more testers overtime. If you request access and get the chance to be part of this Playtest, please also [join Discord](https://discord.gg/h8pBSNkzXd) and/or fill the Feedback Form from within the game, your opinion means a lot, and will help me making the best possible game I can. 

By the way, if you join the Discord and write to me I could also give you a Playtest key directly to be sure you have access to the game.
